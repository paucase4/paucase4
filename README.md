## Hi! I am a Computer Engineer and Data Science student based in Romeoville, IL

I am passionate about extracting valuable information from large sources of data. I am very curious and enjoy learning about technology. 

I use Machine Learning models to take advantage of large sources of data, providing insights and predictions. To complement this, I use data visualizations to present these pieces of data to others.
